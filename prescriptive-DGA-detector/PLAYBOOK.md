# Incident Response Playbook

## Alert Context
- **Alert:** Potential DGA domain detected in DNS logs.
- **Domain:** {'length': 18.0, 'entropy': 0.8333333333333334}
- **AI Model Explanation (from SHAP):** High entropy and length contributed to DGA classification.

## Prescriptive Playbook
1. **Isolate the affected system(s):**  Disconnect the endpoint(s) communicating with the suspected DGA domain from the network to prevent further communication and potential lateral movement.

2. **Collect forensic artifacts:** Capture network traffic logs, DNS logs, and memory dumps from the affected system(s).

3. **Analyze the collected artifacts:** Examine the collected data to identify the malware responsible for generating the DGA queries and determine the extent of the compromise.

4. **Remediate and restore:** Clean the infected system(s), update antivirus/endpoint detection and response (EDR) software, and restore affected systems from a known good backup.  If a backup is unavailable, rebuild the system.
