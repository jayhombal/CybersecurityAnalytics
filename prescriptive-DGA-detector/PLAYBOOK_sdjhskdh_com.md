## Playbook: Suspicious Domain Incident Response (AI-Flagged DGA/Phishing Indicators)

**Alert Context:** AI model flagged `sdjhskdh.com` with high `length` and `entropy` contributions, suggesting a potential DGA-generated domain or a crafted phishing/malware distribution domain.

**Objective:** To investigate `sdjhskdh.com`, determine its malicious nature, contain any related threat, eradicate compromise, and recover affected systems.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Cybersecurity Analyst

**Phase 1: Triage & Initial Assessment**

1.  **Validate Alert & Context:**
    *   Confirm the source of the alert (e.g., DNS logs, proxy logs, EDR).
    *   Note the exact timestamp and any associated internal IP addresses or usernames.
    *   Understand if this was a *lookup*, a *connection attempt*, or a *successful connection*.

2.  **External Threat Intelligence Check:**
    *   **Action:** Lookup `sdjhskdh.com` on multiple threat intelligence platforms (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, AbuseIPDB, Talos Intelligence, Mandiant Advantage).
    *   **Goal:** Determine if the domain is already known for malware C2, phishing, spam, or other malicious activities. Note any associated IPs or file hashes.

3.  **DNS & WHOIS Analysis:**
    *   **Action:** Perform `dig` or `nslookup` on `sdjhskdh.com` to check if it resolves to an IP address.
    *   **Action:** Execute `whois sdjhskdh.com` to check the domain registration date (newly registered domains are often suspicious), registrar, and registrant contact information.
    *   **Goal:** Identify if it's an active domain, its age, and ownership details.

4.  **Confirm Entropy/DGA Indicators:**
    *   **Action:** Acknowledge the AI model's findings (high entropy, unusual length) as strong indicators of a DGA domain or a domain designed for evasion.
    *   **Goal:** Reinforce the initial suspicion and guide the focus of the investigation.

**Phase 2: Internal Investigation**

5.  **Identify Affected Systems/Users:**
    *   **Action:** Query your DNS logs, web proxy logs, firewall logs, and EDR/SIEM for any internal attempts to resolve or connect to `sdjhskdh.com`.
    *   **Action:** Identify all source IPs, usernames, and the specific times of interaction.
    *   **Goal:** Determine the scope of potential exposure or compromise.

6.  **Analyze Network Traffic (If Connections Occurred):**
    *   **Action:** If connections were made, review network flow data (NetFlow/IPFIX) and available packet captures (PCAPs) related to `sdjhskdh.com`.
    *   **Goal:** Look for C2 communication patterns, data exfiltration, download of suspicious files, or abnormal traffic characteristics.

7.  **Endpoint Examination (If Endpoints Connected):**
    *   **Action:** For any internal systems that successfully connected to `sdjhskdh.com`, initiate a full endpoint scan using your EDR/AV solutions.
    *   **Action:** Investigate running processes, network connections, file system changes, and persistence mechanisms (registry, scheduled tasks, startup folders).
    *   **Goal:** Identify malware presence, indicators of compromise (IOCs), or evidence of a successful exploit.

**Phase 3: Containment**

8.  **Implement Network Block:**
    *   **Action:** Immediately block `sdjhskdh.com` at your perimeter firewall, DNS sinkhole, web proxy, and endpoint security solutions (e.g., DNS filter, host-based firewall).
    *   **Goal:** Prevent any further internal systems from resolving or connecting to the suspicious domain.

9.  **Isolate Affected Endpoints (If Compromise Confirmed):**
    *   **Action:** If malware or compromise is confirmed on any endpoint, immediately isolate it from the network.
    *   **Goal:** Prevent lateral movement and further damage.

---

**Phase 4: Eradication & Recovery**

10. **Malware Removal & System Remediation:**
    *   **Action:** If malware was identified, follow your organization's malware removal procedures. This may include cleaning, re-imaging, or restoring from known clean backups.
    *   **Action:** Reset any potentially compromised user credentials (especially if a phishing attempt was confirmed).
    *   **Goal:** Eliminate the threat from affected systems.

11. **Vulnerability Remediation:**
    *   **Action:** If the compromise was due to an identified vulnerability (e.g., unpatched software), ensure the vulnerability is patched or mitigated across all relevant systems.
    *   **Goal:** Prevent recurrence through the same vector.

12. **Monitor for Recurrence:**
    *   **Action:** Continue to monitor network and endpoint logs for any attempts to bypass the block or establish connections to related malicious infrastructure.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the threat is fully eradicated and not resurfacing.

**Phase 5: Post-Incident & Reporting**

13. **Document Findings:**
    *   **Action:** Compile all evidence, investigation steps, actions taken, and the final outcome into an incident report. Include all IOCs (domain, IP, file hashes).
    *   **Goal:** Create a comprehensive record for auditing, lessons learned, and future reference.

14. **Update Security Posture:**
    *   **Action:** Based on the findings, update internal detection rules, threat intelligence feeds, and consider security awareness training if a user-based compromise (e.g., phishing) was involved.
    *   **Goal:** Improve future detection and prevention capabilities.

15. **Communicate:**
    *   **Action:** Inform relevant stakeholders (e.g., management, legal, other security teams) as per organizational incident response policy.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure appropriate parties are aware and necessary follow-up actions are taken.
