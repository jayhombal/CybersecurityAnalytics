**Incident Response Playbook: AI Anomaly Alert (Google.com Anomaly)**

**Alert Summary:** AI model detected anomalous activity related to `google.com`, with `length` and `entropy` being the primary positive contributors to the alert score.

**Severity:** Medium (Requires immediate investigation to determine true nature)

**Goal:** Determine if `google.com` is being legitimately accessed but exhibiting unusual patterns, or if it's involved in malicious activity (e.g., C2, data exfiltration, typo-squatting, legitimate service abuse).

**Playbook Steps for Cybersecurity Analyst:**

**Phase 1: Initial Assessment & Context Gathering**

1.  **Identify Triggering Event:**
    *   Retrieve the *full log event* or *raw data* that triggered this AI alert.
    *   Determine the *source* (IP, hostname, user, process) and *destination* (specific `google.com` IP/URL) involved.
    *   Identify the *protocol* and *application* (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, specific browser process, custom application).
    *   **Tools:** SIEM, EDR logs, Network Flow/Packet Capture.

2.  **Examine "Length" & "Entropy" Context:**
    *   **If URL/DNS Query:** Inspect the *full URL path, query parameters, or DNS subdomain*. Is there an unusually long string, random-looking characters, or high base64/hex encoding present?
    *   **If Network Payload:** Analyze the specific packet data or application layer payload content for abnormal length or high entropy (e.g., encrypted/obfuscated data where it shouldn't be).
    *   **Tools:** Browser history, DNS logs, proxy logs, packet capture analysis tools (Wireshark), EDR process details.

**Phase 2: Validation & Analysis**

3.  **Verify `google.com` Legitimacy:**
    *   Confirm the resolved IP address of `google.com` is a known, legitimate Google IP range.
    *   Check for any redirects or CNAME records that might point to a suspicious domain.
    *   **Tools:** DNS lookups (dig, nslookup), IP reputation services (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Talos Intelligence).

4.  **Correlate with Threat Intelligence & Baselines:**
    *   Search for known abuse cases of legitimate Google services (e.g., C2 over Google Drive, data exfiltration via Google Forms).
    *   Compare the observed "length" and "entropy" patterns against typical, benign `google.com` interactions within your environment.
    *   **Tools:** Internal baselines, Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs), public malware repositories (e.g., Any.Run, Hybrid Analysis for C2 patterns).

5.  **User/Host Investigation (If Applicable):**
    *   If a specific user or host is involved, review their recent activity for other suspicious behaviors (e.g., access to other malicious sites, unusual process executions, high network egress).
    *   **Tools:** EDR, DLP, Identity Provider logs.

**Phase 3: Containment (If Malicious Confirmed)**

6.  **Isolate Affected Host/User (If Malicious):**
    *   If malicious activity is confirmed (e.g., C2, data exfiltration), immediately isolate the affected endpoint or user account.
    *   **Action:** Disconnect from network, disable user account.

7.  **Block Malicious Indicators (If Malicious):**
    *   If a specific malicious subdomain, URL path, or IP is identified as part of the attack, block it at the firewall, proxy, or DNS level.
    *   **Action:** Add indicators to deny lists.

**Phase 4: Eradication & Recovery**

8.  **Eradicate Malware/Threat (If Malicious):**
    *   Follow standard malware eradication procedures (e.g., remove malicious files, terminate processes, clean persistence mechanisms).
    *   **Action:** Run AV scan, re-image, patch vulnerabilities.

9.  **Restore Services:**
    *   Bring affected systems or users back online after thorough cleanup and verification.

**Phase 5: Post-Incident Activities**

10. **Document Findings:**
    *   Record all observations, steps taken, and conclusions. Note the specific "length" and "entropy" patterns found.
    *   **Action:** Update incident management system.

11. **Refine Detection:**
    *   If this was a false positive, adjust AI model thresholds or add new baselines.
    *   If it was a true positive, consider developing more specific detection rules for similar future threats leveraging `google.com` or similar services with high length/entropy indicators.
    *   **Action:** Update SIEM rules, EDR policies, AI model training data.
